# Covid-19 World API
A simple app that tracks Covid-19 data of current date + some additional country info. 

This is my first `Node.js` project as part of training. The app  is hosted on heroku using a free dyno, so if it loads slowly just wait until it wakes up from idle ðŸ’¤.

Data sourced from Worldometers database.
